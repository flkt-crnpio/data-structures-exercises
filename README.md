# Data structures



### Lists
List in Python are a mutable collections of objects that can or not be homogenous. A single list can contain strings, integers, as well as objects.


### Arrays
In JS an array are list-like objects is a collection of elements indexed. The length and the type of its elements
are not fixed. Data can be any type and can be stored at non-contiguous location in the array.


In Python an array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. An array in python can be created by importing the `array` module `array.(data_type, value_list)` and can only contain same data type.


### Queues
Is a collection of elements that follows the first-in-first-out rule (FIFO)
